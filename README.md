What is TPC

By working proactively with governments and policymakers, TPC helps the industry achieve better regulation.
Vision

Our vision is to become the number one cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, usability and number of users. TPC aims to grant access to financial services to everyone by providing educational tools and simplifying and demystifying cryptocurrency. TPC makes it possible for its millions of users to make easier and faster payments around the globe.

What is TPC?

TPC is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference. Payments are done in Ether to execute operations on TPC network. The currency avoids spam programs and keeps the network healthy. Cryptocurrencies are based on trust and transparency. The block-chain transparency system enables you an oversight of where your S-coin came from, as well as the possibility to track its every single move along the chain, all the way back to the moment of its creation. However, since the transactions are completely anonymous, all your personal information remains hidden. On-site technicians ensure continuous monitoring and servicing of individual elements of the mining structure.
